# Smallest Positive missing number

You are given an array arr[] of N integers including 0. The task is to find the smallest positive number missing from the array.

## Example 1:

          Input:
          N = 5
          arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
          Output: 6
          Explanation: Smallest positive missing 
          number is 6.


## Example 2:

          Input:
          N = 5
          arr[] = {0,-10,1,3,-20}
          Output: 2
          Explanation: Smallest positive missing 
          number is 2.



## Your Task:

The task is to complete the function missingNumber() which returns the smallest positive missing number in the array.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 106
-106 <= arr[i] <= 106
